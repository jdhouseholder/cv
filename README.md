Chocolate Vision

Transfer learning MobilenetV3 pre-trained on ImageNet to dataset of Chocolates!

This code isn't particularly usable without the dataset, but does show how to:

* Adjust the output size of ResNet18, MobilenetV2, MobilenetV3 Large, and MobilenetV3 Small.
* Freeze the CNN portion of the models and train the final layers.
